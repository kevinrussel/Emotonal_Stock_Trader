# Emotonal_Stock_Trader
This is a project that I am undertaking to run an experiment
Start date: Sep/25/24

Before starting notes:
Hello! Thank you for looking at the readme, my name is Kevin and I a undertaking a pretty hard personal project that deals with different Ai models.

Houskeeping tasks first:
I don't know if anyone is going to check this out, but if you do! Hello! It's really nice of you to join me.
This readme is going to act more like a journal entries just so that I can keep an emotional feelings and tracker until I finish this project.

With that being said,lets begin


Entry #1) 
This entry is to start the repo, as well as act as a guideline on what this project is doing.

This is the synopsis of the project:
	I want to compare how different Ai models react to a news articles between different new's sites and their biases on wheter they will buy/sell a certain stock.

I hope that makes sense?
I have class in like 10 minutes so I may add stuff later in the day but the way I want to approach this is by splitting this project into 3 distinct sections

1) Getting the trader and its api so that we can buy/sell the stock (I am starting with this since it will probably be the easiest to implement first)
2) Making a web sraper that findes the article's
3) The ai api and response.
