# Emotonal_Stock_Trader
This is a project that I am undertaking to run an experiment
Start date: Sep/25/24

Before starting notes:
Hello! Thank you for looking at the readme, my name is Kevin and I a undertaking a pretty hard personal project that deals with different Ai models.

Houskeeping tasks first:
I don't know if anyone is going to check this out, but if you do! Hello! It's really nice of you to join me.
This readme is going to act more like a journal entries just so that I can keep an emotional feelings and tracker until I finish this project.

With that being said,lets begin


Entry #1) 
This entry is to start the repo, as well as act as a guideline on what this project is doing.

This is the synopsis of the project:
	I want to compare how different Ai models react to a news articles between different new's sites and their biases on wheter they will buy/sell a certain stock.

I hope that makes sense?
I have class in like 10 minutes so I may add stuff later in the day but the way I want to approach this is by splitting this project into 3 distinct sections

1) Getting the trader and its api so that we can buy/sell the stock (I am starting with this since it will probably be the easiest to implement first)
	I think my first step is to find a website that I can buy and sell fake stokes
	There are a couple constraints I am looking for
	1) It must have an api I can interact with
	2) It should show real time data
	3) It should be of the nasdaq or other major trader.
		


2) Making a web sraper that findes the article's
3) The ai api and response.


Entry #2) Sep/26/24

Ok this in entry number two, so this is where I breakdown the trader and api.

So here is where I see the problem, I need to get api's of stock prices in real time, there is a thing I have been seeing lately and that is paper tradeing, so will look more into that.
Update, so I looked into it, the best application I found that would fit my need seems to be TD-ameritrade. So will look into that.

entry #3) Sep/27/24

This is getting more and more infuriating, TD ameritrade doesn't seem to have multiple paper-trdaing account, so back to the drawing board. I think I found a cool one called we-bull?
Update #1: Ok so I have found one that seems to work, its called Alpaca, this has an api which is huge. Will have to look at the documentation to get the api up and running

entry #4) Sep/29/24

It was hoco last night so..... yea i didn't get too much work done yesterday.

Anyway, that's fine, what I want to do do today is try and get the api key working for my project from apacha. Lets see how this goes.

entry #5) I need to update this soon. Sometimes I wonder what my purpose is? What is the reason why I was put on this plaent? and why is it that I was put on this during the most "peaceful"
time in human history? I have no idea, but I feel as if that is for me to find out. Do i believe in a god? I don't know. All science points to the answer no, but maybe it's because I started going to church 
at a very young age, but I still hold out hope for a god. Anyway, I should probably not make this my personal diary, but I mean what can you do? Probably no one is going to be reading this, so i wonder if 
it even matters, but at that point, does anything matter? Truly? Anyway, I need to do my other projects and then I will start working on this. 

entry #6) Oct,1,24
Ok this is the 6th entry in the very slow progress that i am making, it is offically the first day of october, I hope to have this project operational soon, but who knows? My goal is by 
the 20th (that gives me 20 more days to finish this project). So I have to make sure that I stay on the grind and continue moving forward. The goal of today is to get the code running so
that I may be able to buy a single stock. That is the idea. 
Ok ciao.
